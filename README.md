**Improve Host Communication:** Encourage hosts to respond promptly to inquiries to increase booking conversion rates. Tools that prioritize urgent inquiries or automate initial responses could be beneficial.

**Tailored Marketing for Key Origin Countries:** Develop targeted marketing campaigns for the top origin countries, particularly focusing on the preferences of travelers from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

**Address Larger Group Needs:** Work on identifying and addressing the specific needs of larger groups, such as clearer descriptions of large group accommodations or special group discounts.
