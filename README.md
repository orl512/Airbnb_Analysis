North Star Metrics and Key Dimensions
Booking Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who proceed from searching and making inquiries to completing a booking. This metric directly impacts Airbnb's revenue and operational efficiency by reflecting the effectiveness of the platform and hosts in converting interest into confirmed stays.

Inquiry Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who, after searching, make an inquiry to a host. This metric is crucial as it indicates the level of interest generated by listings and is a precursor to the booking conversion rate. Higher inquiry conversion rates suggest that listings are appealing and relevant to usersâ€™ needs.

Key Dimensions
Guest Group Size: Understanding the typical group size helps tailor accommodations to meet demand.
Room Type Preference: The types of accommodations users prefer, which guides hosts in listing and marketing their properties effectively.
Origin Country of Searches: Identifying the geographical origin of searches to tailor marketing strategies and listing content.
Stay Duration and Check-in Days: Patterns in the length of stay and preferred check-in days, useful for creating targeted promotions and flexible booking options.

Most searches are for 1 or 2 guests, indicating a preference for smaller accommodations.
Users predominantly search for short stays, with a high concentration of searches for weekend check-ins (Friday and Saturday).
75% of users search for accommodations 1-2 months in advance, though there is a significant number of last-minute searches.
Host Inquiries and Booking Patterns:

Over half of users make inquiries after searching, but only about 23.68% convert into bookings.
Conversion rates drop significantly for larger groups, suggesting challenges in finding suitable accommodations.
Faster response times from hosts are correlated with higher booking rates.
Geographical Insights:

Recommendations
Optimize Listings for Smaller Groups: Focus on enhancing smaller accommodations, such as studios or one-bedroom apartments, to cater to the predominant market segment of solo travelers and couples.

Cater to Short-Term and Weekend Stays: Offer flexible check-in/out times and weekend packages to attract short-stay travelers. Marketing efforts should highlight Dublin as a top destination for weekend getaways.

Dynamic Pricing Strategies: Implement pricing strategies that reward early bookings while keeping some inventory available for last-minute bookings at premium rates. This can capture both early planners and those looking for immediate stays.

Improve Host Communication: Encourage hosts to respond promptly to inquiries to increase booking conversion rates. Tools that prioritize urgent inquiries or automate initial responses could be beneficial.

Tailored Marketing for Key Origin Countries: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for the top origin countries, particularly focusing on the preferences of travelers from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
